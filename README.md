## A quick project using the [FootBall Data](https://www.football-data.org/) API t create a minimal but very colourful live Premier League table.

### Next steps:

- add the rest of the table data (wins/draws/losses/points)
- create a dropdown section for each team that reveals more information (next fixture, last result, news items etc.)

### Feel free to contribute!!!
